   <h3>Some facts</h3>
   <p>Fastest mammal on land, the cheetah can reach speeds of 60 or perhaps even 70 miles (97 or 113 kilometers) an hour over short distances. It usually chases its prey at only about half that speed, however. After a chase, a cheetah needs half an hour to catch its breath before it can eat.

The cheetah's excellent eyesight helps it find prey during the day. The cheetah is hard to see because its spotted coat blends with the tall, dry grass of the plains. Suddenly, the cheetah makes a lightning dash. It knocks its prey to the ground and then bites its throat. Once found throughout Asia and Africa, cheetahs today are racing toward extinction. Loss of habitat and declining numbers of their prey combine to threaten the future of these cats. Cheetahs live and hunt mainly in open grasslands and bushy areas in parts of Africa and the Middle East.

Cheetahs eat small- to medium-size animals, such as hares, impalas, wildebeest calves, and gazelles.</p>
    <p>Considered a big cat only because it is tall, the Cheetah is actually the same overall size as our Cougar (Felis concolor). Cats, generally, are obviously longer than they are tall, with powerfully muscular legs. The Cheetah is square  the same height to the withers as it is long (from chest to rump). Elements of the legs are long and lean, especially the radius/ulna, tibia/fibula, metacarpals (the palm) and metatarsals (the foot). The skull is about the same size as the Cougar, but is slightly more domed, back to front. The tail is long enough to touch the ground with the Cheetah standing. Although a cubs claws can, to some degree, retract, adult Cheetah claws do not retract and are, therefore, blunted. Males are slightly larger than females, but with no other sexual dimorphism.

<p>Cheetahs need wide expanses of grassland. Gallery forest and heavy brush interfere with their ability to run. Cheetahs do well in more arid habitats. They occur in the band of Sub-Saharan savannah that stretches across northern Africa, down the eastern grasslands south of Somalia and across southern Africa westward into the Kalahari Desert region. There is a small population near the mouth of the Red Sea, in Ethiopia, and another that may still exist at the southern end of the Caspian Sea, in Iran.</p>

    <p>Cheetahs are tawny yellow with black thumb-print spots. All Cheetahs have a black eye-stripe down the cheek to the corners of the mouth. The belly fur is usually white, as is the very tip of the tail. Cheetah cubs have long white hairs that run in a crest down their backs. As with any animal species, genetic mutations may produce aberrant colors and patterns.
