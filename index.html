    	<p>Lets say you're the brand manager for Hearts of Iron from Paradox. How should you find good streamers to reach out to? You could try a game name directly, like 'Hearts of Iron', check a related title like Civilization 5', or a genre like 'Grand Strategy'. Woovit searches the Title, Description and Meta tags from all our streamers' YouTube and Twitch feeds.</p>

                        </h1>
      <p>Woovit provides a list of streamers that match your term - by default sorted by Relevance, though you may use the drop down menu to sort by number of YouTube or Twitch subscribers. You can add as many of these to a list directly from the search results by clicking on the check boxes in the upper right of the streamer's rectangle. Or you can click on any streamer profile to examine further. Benjamin Magnus looks like an up and coming streamer you should keep tabs on. Click on that result.</p>

      <p>The resulting page propogates your search term to search withing all Benjamin Magnus Games's videos. (To see all of his videos, and search his work more thoroughly, click on his profile or "show all videos. The graphs on the upper right give historic data on his viewership (you may click to expand.) His professional email and twitter handle are there as well. The "Tags" sections are tags the most frequent tags he uses across all videos. Clearly this is someone very interested in the game, and you should seek to develop a relationship. Click the yellow "Add to List" button next to his name.</p>

      <p>After a list interface pops up, you can choose which of your lists to add Benjamin Magnus to. Unlike maintaining your streamer lists in a spreadsheet, the data is automatically updated daily. You can export this list to a .csv file for use in a standalone spreadsheet if you wish.</p>
