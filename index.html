    	<p>Lets say you're the brand manager for <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/394360/">Hearts of Iron</a> from Paradox. How should you find good streamers to reach out to? You could try a game name directly, like 'Hearts of Iron', check a related title like 'Civilization 5', or a genre like 'Grand Strategy'. Woovit searches the Title, Description and Meta tags from all our streamers' YouTube and Twitch feeds.</p>

      <p>Woovit provides a list of streamers that match your term - by default sorted by Relevance, though you may use the drop down menu to sort by number of YouTube or Twitch subscribers. You can add as many of these to a list directly from the search results by clicking on the check boxes in the upper right of the streamer's rectangle. Or you can click on any streamer profile to examine further.</p>

      <p> Benjamin Magnus looks like an up and coming streamer. Click on that result to learn more.</p>

      <p>The resulting page uses your search term to look within all Benjamin Magnus Games's videos. To see all of his videos, and search his work more thoroughly, click on his profile or "show all videos". The graphs on the upper right give historic data on his viewership--click to expand for a larger view. His professional email and twitter handle are there as well. The "Tags" sections are tags the most frequent tags he uses across all videos. We also have their Twitter and contact information if any.</p>

      <p>Clearly this is someone very interested in the game, and you should seek to develop a relationship. Click the yellow "Add to List" button next to his name.</p>

Unlike maintaining your streamer lists in a spreadsheet, the data is automatically updated daily. You can export this list to a .csv file for use in a standalone spreadsheet if you wish.</p>

      <p>Newsflash: there are a lot of videos online. You can get email alerts from YouTube and Twitch when a streamer has new content. But you can't filter by search term, or number of views. You can also get alerts when the influence of their channel increases. We need your email to alert you, so register to get alerts!</p>
